	Ever since I began going to university, I've been interested in electronic music.  My first major exposure
	to any kind of eletronica event was the Phoenix Festival down in Washington State, which was 4 days of almost
	non-stop music playing from 10 different stages.  Since then my interest has grown dramatically.
</p>	
	
<p>	
	There's something about the
	low bass, and the repetitiveness of the beats that draws me in.  I feel like I am instinctively seeking
	a state of mind that was once felt by our ancestors as they danced around a fire banging on primitive drums.
	Ultimately, I am trying to find the "perfect beat" that matches a key wavelength in my brain, as if it were the
	missing piece to the puzzle of Zen Enlightenment.

	One of my dreams has been to actually spin vinyl on my own.  Until recently it was a tad beyond my reach in regards to
	both time and money.  However, as of early 2008 I have begun doing my own mixing on two Tektonic 1200 mk6's.  
	My genre of choice is <strong>Drum'n'Bass</strong>.
