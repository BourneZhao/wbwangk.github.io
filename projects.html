<h3 id="project_mojobojo">Project Mojobojo</h3>

<p>
	That would be this site.  It's too small and lightweight to warrant some kind of web framework like Rails, so I've
	opted to make an html generator using Ruby's ERb template system.
</p>

<p>
	I kind of see mojobojo as my "proof that I have basic html and css skills" project.
</p>

<h3 id="project_go">Project Go</h3>

<p>
	As in the board game.  I have been playing since 2002, and am currently ranked 4kyu on the Kiseido Go Server (KGS).
	On occasion I play at a Go club with relatively stronger players here in Japan, and am ranked 1dan.  I was written up in the Kyoto
	Newspaper for playing at Japanese Go Clubs.  My ultimate goal is to reach KGS 1dan level in rank.
</p>

<p>
	My interest in Go also carries over into Artificial Intelligence.  Solving Go on a computer is known to be one of the
	bigger challenges in computing right now, and is said to require more creative methods than pure brute force to solve.
	This interest is on the back burner for now, however, to make room for the two billion other hobbies I have.  Note
	that a Ruby code base has already been developed for the board handling.
</p>

<h3 id="project_japanese">Project Japanese</h3>

<p>
	I have been studying the language and culture since Fall of 2002, and it has been very rewarding.  I am still not
	fluent, and can't even read a newspaper yet.  My goal is to pass the 2kyu Japanese Language Proficiency Test.  However,
	Living in Japan has dramatically increased my listening and speaking abilities.  I am partial to using the
	Kansai dialect.
